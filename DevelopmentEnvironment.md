# Development Environment

The following details the minimum set of tools required to develop for HyosungTools. All of them are free. This document will walk through the different tools you need. All development is on Win10.

## Visual Studio/VSCode

You need an editor. The primary language is C#. If you have a favorite editor, use it. I prefer [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). There is a community version. Another option is [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  

## Build Tools

You need to install [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) - see available from this download page (see the Tools for Visual Studio section).

## GitHub and Git

You will need a personal [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.

You need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machine.

## Beyond Compare

May not be required. There's a difftool in GitHub. But its good to use it locally.
